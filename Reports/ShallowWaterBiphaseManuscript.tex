\begin{abstract}
Wave shape (\eg{} wave skewness and asymmetry) impacts sediment
transport, remote sensing and ship safety.
Previous work showed that wind affects wave shape in intermediate and
deep water.
\begin{LineLabel}{R1-5}
Here, we investigate the effect of wind on wave shape in shallow water
through a wind-induced surface pressure for different wind speeds and
directions to provide the first theoretical description of wind-induced
shape changes.
\end{LineLabel}
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-5}
A multiple-scale analysis of long waves propagating over a shallow,
flat bottom and forced by a Jeffreys-type surface pressure yields a
forward or backward Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)-Burgers equation for the
wave profile, depending on the wind direction.
\end{LineLabel}
The evolution of a symmetric, solitary wave initial condition is
calculated numerically.
The resulting wave grows (decays) for onshore (offshore) wind and
becomes asymmetric, with the rear face showing the largest shape
changes.
The wave profile's deviation from a reference solitary wave shows a
bound, dispersive, decaying tail.
The onshore wind increases the wave's energy and skewness with time
while decreasing the wave's asymmetry, with the opposite holding for
offshore wind.
The corresponding wind speeds are shown to be physically realistic, and
the shape changes are explained as slow growth followed by rapid
evolution according to the unforced KdV equation.

\section{\label{sec:introduction} Introduction}

The study of wind and ocean wave interactions began with
\citet{jeffreys1925formation} and continues to be an active field of
research~\citep[\eg][]{janssen1991quasi,donelan2006wave,sulivan2010dynamics}.
Many theoretical
studies~\citep[\eg][]{jeffreys1925formation,miles1957generation,phillips1957generation}
focus on calculating wind-induced growth rates and often employ
phase-averaging techniques.
However, wind can also influence wave shape, quantified by third-order
shape statistics such as skewness and asymmetry, corresponding to
vertical and horizontal asymmetry,
respectively~\citep[\eg][]{leykin1995asymmetry,feddersen2005wind,zdyrski2020wind}.
Wave shape influences sediment transport affecting beach
morphodynamics~\citep[\eg][]{drake2001discrete,hoefel2003wave}, while
wave skewness affects radar altimetry
signals~\citep[\eg][]{hayne1980radar} and asymmetry influences ship
responses to wave impacts~\citep[\eg][]{soares2008abnormal}.

Waves in shallow water, where $kh \ll 1$ (with $h$ the water depth and
$k=2\pi/\lambda$ the wavenumber), differ qualitatively from those in
intermediate ($kh \sim 1$) to deep ($kh \gg 1$) water.
For waves with small amplitudes $a_0 \ll h$,
leveraging the small parameters $a_0/h \sim (kh)^2 \ll 1$
yields the Boussinesq equations with weak dispersion and nonlinearity.
When dispersion balances nonlinear
focusing, a special class of waves known as solitary waves are formed
and appear in environments ranging from nonlinear optical pulses
\citep[\eg][]{kivshar1993dark} to astrophysical dusty plasmas
\citep[\eg][]{sahu2012nonextensive}.
One of the simplest equations displaying solitary waves is the
Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, which incorporates dispersion and
nonlinearity.
When augmented with a dissipative term, this becomes the KdV-Burgers
equation, with applications to damped internal tides
\citep[\eg][]{sandstrom1995dissipation}, electron waves in graphene
\citep[\eg][]{zdyrski2019effects} and viscous flow in blood vessels
\citep[\eg][]{antar1999weakly}.

\begin{LineLabel}{R1-7}
The influence of wind on wave shape has been previously investigated in
intermediate and deep water~\citep{zdyrski2020wind}.
However, the coupling between wind and wave shape has not yet been
investigated in shallow water.
\end{LineLabel}
To investigate wind and surface wave interactions in shallow water over
a flat bottom, we introduce a wind-induced pressure term to the
Boussinesq equations in \cref{sec:derivation}.
The resulting KdV-Burgers equation governs a solitary wave's evolution,
which we solve numerically
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-2}
to yield the wave's energy, skewness and asymmetry
\end{LineLabel}
in \cref{sec:results}.
We calculate the wind speed, discuss the asymmetry and
compare our results to intermediate- and deep-water waves in
\cref{sec:discussion}.

\section{\label{sec:derivation} Derivation of the KdV-Burgers equation}

\subsection{\label{sec:governing} Governing equations}
We treat the flow as irrotational and inviscid and neglect surface
tension.
Furthermore, we restrict to planar wave propagation in the $+x$
direction.
Finally, we choose a coordinate system with $z=0$ at the mean water
level and a horizontal, flat bottom located at $z=-h$.
Then, the incompressibility condition and standard boundary conditions
are
\begin{alignat}{2}
  0 &= \phi_{xx} + \phi_{zz} &&\qq{on}
  -h < z < \eta \,, \label{eq:laplace}\\
  0 &= \phi_{z} &&\qq{on} z=-h \,, \label{eq:bottom_bc}\\
  \phi_{z} &= \eta_{t} + \phi_{x} \eta_{x} &&\qq{on} z = \eta \,,
  \label{eq:kinematic_bc}\\
  0 &= \frac{p}{\rho_w} + g\eta + \phi_{t} +
  \frac{1}{2} \bqty{\phi_{x}^2 + \phi_{z}^2} &&\qq{on} z=
  \eta \,. \label{eq:dynamic_bc}
\end{alignat}
Here, $\eta(x,t)$ is the wave profile, $\phi(x,z,t)$ is the flow's
velocity potential related to the velocity $\vec{u} = \grad{\phi}$,
$p(x,t)$ is the surface pressure, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration
and $\rho_w$ is the water density.
We used $\phi$'s gauge freedom to absorb the Bernoulli `constant'
$C(t)$ in the dynamic boundary condition.
We seek a solitary, progressive wave which decays at infinity,
$\eta(\vec{x},t) \to 0$ as $\abs{\vec{x}} \to \infty$, with similar
conditions on $\vec{u}$.
We choose a coordinate system where the average bottom horizontal
velocity vanishes,
\begin{equation}
  \overline{ \pdv{\phi}{x} } = 0 \qq{on} z=-h \,,
  \label{eq:bot_bc_horz}
\end{equation}
with the overline a spatial average $\overline{f} \coloneqq
\lim_{L\to\infty} \int_{-L}^{L} f \dd{x} / (2L)$.
Additionally, we assume the surface pressure $p(x,t)$ is a Jeffreys-type
forcing \citep{jeffreys1925formation},
\begin{equation}
  p(x,t) = P \pdv{\eta(x,t)}{x} \,.
  \label{eq:press_def}
\end{equation}
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-11}
Here, $P$ is proportional to $(U-c)^2$, with $c=\sqrt{gh}$ the shallow
water phase speed and $U$ the wind speed (\cf{} \cref{sec:press_mag}),
\end{LineLabel}
Note that $P>0$ corresponds to (`onshore') wind in the same direction as
the wave while $P<0$ denotes (`offshore') wind opposite the wave. We use
a Jeffreys forcing for its analytic simplicity and clear demonstration
of wind-wave coupling.
Jeffrey's separated sheltering mechanism is likely only relevant
in special situations (\eg{} near breaking,
\citealp{banner1976separation}, or for steep waves under strong winds,
\citealp{tian2013evolution,touboul2006interaction}).
Additionally, numerical simulations of sinusoidal waves suggest the peak
surface pressure is shifted approximately \SI{135}{\degree} from the
wave peak, while Jeffreys would give a \SI{90}{\degree}
shift~\citep{husain2019boundary}.
However, a fully dynamic coupling between wind and waves---necessary for
an accurate surface pressure over a non-sinusoidal, dynamic water
surface---is outside the scope of this paper.
\begin{LineLabel}{R3-1}
Furthermore, the applicability of Jeffreys forcing to extreme waves
means our theory could apply to the wind forcing of rogue waves in
shallow water~\citep{kharif2008influence}.
\end{LineLabel}

\subsection{\label{sec:nondim} Non-dimensionalization}
We non-dimensionalize our system with the known characteristic
scales: the horizontal length scale $L$ over which $\eta$ changes
rapidly, expressed as an effective wavenumber $k_E \coloneqq 2 \pi/L$;
the (initial) wave amplitude $a_0 = H_0/2$ (\ie{} half the wave height
$H_0$); the depth $h$; the gravitational acceleration $g$; and the wind
speed $U$, expressed as a pressure magnitude $P \propto \rho_a (U-c)^2$.
Denoting non-dimensional variables with primes, we have
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  x &= \frac{x'}{k_E} = h \frac{x'}{\sqrt{\mu_E}}\,, \\
  z &= h z' \,,
  \end{aligned}
  \qquad
  \begin{aligned}
  t &= \frac{t'}{k_E\sqrt{g h}}
    = \frac{t'}{\sqrt{\mu_E}} \sqrt{\frac{h}{g}} \,, \\
  P &= \epsilon P' \frac{\rho_w g}{k_E}
    = \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{\mu_E}} P' \rho_w g h \,,
  \end{aligned}
  \qquad
  \begin{aligned}
  \eta &= a_0 \eta' = h \epsilon \eta' \,, \\
  \phi &= \phi'\frac{a_0}{k_E}\sqrt{\frac{g}{h}}
    = \frac{\phi'\epsilon}{\sqrt{\mu_E}}\sqrt{g h^3} \,.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Our system's dynamics are controlled by three small, non-dimensional
parameters: $\epsilon \coloneqq a_0/h$, $\mu_E \coloneqq (k_E h)^2$ and
$P k_E/(\rho_w g)$.
We will later require $\order{\epsilon} = \order{\mu_E} =
\order{Pk_E/(\rho_w g)}$.
Now, our non-dimensional equations take the form
\begin{alignat}{2}
  0 &= \mu_E \phi'_{x'x'} + \phi'_{z'z'} &&\qq{on}
    -1 < z' < \epsilon \eta' \,, \label{eq:laplace_nondim} \\
  0 &= \phi'_{z'} &&\qq{on} z'=-1 \,, \label{eq:bottom_bc_nondim} \\
  \phi'_{z'} &= \mu_E \eta'_{t'} +
    \epsilon \mu_E \phi'_{x'} \eta'_{x'} &&\qq{on} z' = \epsilon \eta' \,,
    \label{eq:kinematic_bc_nondim} \\
  0 &= \epsilon P' \eta'_{x'} +  \eta' + \phi'_{t'} + \frac{1}{2}
    \pqty{\epsilon \phi_{x'}^{\prime \, 2} + \frac{\epsilon}{\mu_E}
    \phi_{z'}^{\prime \, 2}} &&\qq{on} z'= \epsilon \eta' \,.
    \label{eq:dynamic_bc_nondim}
\end{alignat}
We will drop the primes throughout the remainder of this section for readability.

\subsection{\label{sec:boussinesq} Boussinesq equations, multiple-scale
expansion, KdV equation and initial condition}
\begin{LineLabel}{R1-1}
\begin{LineLabel}{R1-9}
Here, we modify the Boussinesq equation's derivation provided by
\citet{mei2005nonlinear} or \citet{ablowitz2011nonlinear} by including
the surface pressure forcing in \cref{eq:dynamic_bc}.
\end{LineLabel}
Taylor expanding the velocity potential $\phi$ about the bottom,
$z=-1$, and applying Laplace's
equation \cref{eq:laplace_nondim} and the bottom boundary
condition \cref{eq:bottom_bc_nondim} yields an expansion of $\phi$ in
terms of $\mu_E \ll 1$ and the velocity potential at the bottom,
$\varphi \coloneqq \eval{\phi}_{z=-1}$.
This $\phi$ expansion can be substituted into the two remaining boundary
equations, \cref{eq:kinematic_bc_nondim,eq:dynamic_bc_nondim}, to give
the Boussinesq equations with a pressure forcing term,
\end{LineLabel}
\begin{gather}
  \partial_t \eta + \partial_x^2 \varphi + \epsilon \partial_x
    \pqty{\eta \partial_x \varphi} -\frac{1}{6}\mu_E \partial^4_x
    \varphi = \order{\mu_E^2} \label{eq:kinematic_bc_varphi} \,, \\
  \partial_t \varphi + \epsilon P \partial_x \eta + \eta -
    \frac{1}{2}\mu_E \partial_t \partial_x^2 \varphi +
    \frac{1}{2}\epsilon\pqty{\partial_x \varphi}^2 = \order{\mu_E^2} \,.
    \label{eq:dynamic_bc_varphi}
\end{gather}
Further, we will now assume $\order{\epsilon} = \order{\mu_E} \ll 1$.

We now expand $t$ using multiple time scales $t_n =
\epsilon^n t$ for $n= 0,1$, so all time derivatives become $\partial_t \to
\partial_{t_0} + \epsilon \partial_{t_1}$.
Then, we write $\eta$ and $\varphi$ as asymptotic series of $\epsilon$,
\begin{equation}
  \eta(x,t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \epsilon^k
    \eta_{k+1}(x,t_0,t_1) \qq{and}
  \varphi(x,t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \epsilon^k
    \varphi_{k+1}(x,t_0,t_1,) \,.
\end{equation}
Now, we will reduce the Boussinesq equations,
\cref{eq:kinematic_bc_varphi,eq:dynamic_bc_varphi}, to the KdV equation
following a similar method to \citet{mei2005nonlinear} and
\citet{ablowitz2011nonlinear}.
Collecting order-one terms $\order{\epsilon^0}$ from
\cref{eq:kinematic_bc_varphi,eq:dynamic_bc_varphi} gives
a wave equation for $\eta_0$ and $\phi_0$.
The right-moving solutions are
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_0 = f_0(x-t_0,t_1) \qq{and}
  \eta_0 = f'_0(x-t_0,1) \qq{with}
  f_0' \coloneqq \eval{\pdv{f_0(\theta,t_1)}{\theta}}_{\theta = x-t_0} \,.
\end{equation}
Continuing to the next order of perturbation theory, we retain terms of
order $\order{\epsilon}$,
\begin{gather}
    \pdv{\eta_1}{t_0} + \pdv[2]{\varphi_{1}}{x} =
      -\pdv{\eta_0}{t_1} - \pdv{x} \pqty{\eta_0 \pdv{\varphi_0}{x}} +
      \frac{1}{6} \frac{\mu_E}{\epsilon} \pdv[4]{\varphi_0}{x} \,,
  \\
    \eta_1 + \pdv{\varphi_1}{t_0} = -P \pdv{\eta_0}{x} -\pdv{\varphi_0}{t_1}
      + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\mu_E}{\epsilon} \frac{\partial^3 \varphi_0}
        {\partial t_0 \partial^2 x}
      - \frac{1}{2} \pqty{ \pdv{\varphi_0}{x} }^2
  \,.
\end{gather}
Inserting our leading order solutions for $\eta_0$ and $\varphi_0$,
eliminating $\eta_1$ and preventing resonant forcing of $\varphi_1$
gives the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)-Burgers equation,
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{\eta_0}{t_1} + \frac{3}{2}
    \eta_0 \pdv{\eta_0}{x} + \frac{1}{6} \frac{\mu_E}{\epsilon}
    \pdv[3]{\eta_0}{x} = -P \frac{1}{2} \pdv[2]{\eta_0}{x} \,.
  \label{eq:kdv_burgers}
\end{equation}
Note that \cref{eq:kdv_burgers} has a rescaling symmetry, with $\mu_E
\to \lambda^2 \mu_E$ equivalent to taking $(x,t_0,t_1,P) \to
(x,t_0,t_1,P)/\lambda$.
Therefore, we fix the length scale (equivalently, $k_E$) by choosing
$\mu_E = 6 \epsilon$.
\begin{LineLabel}{R1-4}
Note that incorporating slowly-varying bottom bathymetry $\partial_x h =
\order{\epsilon}$ can yield an equation of the form
\cref{eq:kdv_burgers} with spatially-varying
coefficients~\citep[\eg][]{johnson1972some,ono1972wave}, though such an
analysis is outside the scope of this study.
\end{LineLabel}

\begin{LineLabel}{R2-10}
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-19}
For offshore wind, the pressure term $P \partial^2_x \eta_0$ acts as a
positive viscosity causing damping and \cref{eq:kdv_burgers} is the
(forward) KdV-Burgers equation with $P<0$.
However, for onshore wind, the viscosity is negative and causes wave
growth, yielding the backward KdV-Burgers equation with $P>0$.
\end{LineLabel}
The backward KdV-Burgers equation is ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard
because the solution is highly sensitive to changes in the initial
condition~\citep{hadamard1902problemes}.
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-18}
While a finite-time singularity (\ie{} wave breaking) is likely, the
multiple-scale expansion to derive \cref{eq:kdv_burgers} is only valid
for time intervals of order $\order{1/\epsilon}$, and we limit our
analysis to short times removing the need to regularize the solution.
\end{LineLabel}
\end{LineLabel}

\begin{LineLabel}{R2-7}
The solitary wave solutions of the unforced ($P=0$) KdV equation exist
due to a balance of dispersion $\partial_x^3 \eta_0$ with focusing
nonlinearity $\eta_0 \partial_x \eta_0$ and have the
form~\citep[\eg][]{mei2005nonlinear}
\end{LineLabel}
\begin{equation}
  \eta_0 = H_0 \sech^2\pqty{\frac{x}{\Delta}}
  \qq{with}
  \Delta = \sqrt{\frac{8}{H_0}} \,,
  \label{eq:initial_condition}
\end{equation}
in a co-moving frame with $H_0>0$ an order-1 parameter.
We use \cref{eq:initial_condition} for our initial condition and choose
$H_0 = 2$ so the initial, dimensional amplitude $a_0$ is half the wave
height (\cf{} \cref{sec:nondim}).
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-15}
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-1}
The wind-forcing term $P \partial_x^2 \eta_0$ in \cref{eq:kdv_burgers}
disrupts the solitary wave's balance of dispersion and nonlinearity,
inducing growth/decay and shape changes.
\end{LineLabel}
To calculate the previously described wave
growth~\citep[\eg][]{miles1957generation,cavaleri1981wind} as well as
the novel shape changes, we will solve the KdV-Burgers equation
numerically since it has no known, solitary wave solutions.
\end{LineLabel}

\subsection{\label{sec:numerics} Numerics and shape statistics}
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-8}
To solve \cref{eq:kdv_burgers} numerically, we will use the Dedalus
spectral solver~\citep{burns2020dedalus} which implements a generalized
tau method with a Chebyshev basis.
Since the onshore wind, $P>0$ case is ill-posed, we require an implicit
solver, so time stepping is done with a 3rd-order 4-stage DIRK+ERK
scheme.
The spatial domain has a length of $L=80$ with periodic boundary
conditions.
We employ $N_c = 1600$ Chebyshev coefficients and zero-padding with a
scaling factor of $3/2$ to prevent aliasing of nonlinear terms.
This corresponds to $N_x = 2400$ spatial points with an average spacing
of $\Delta x = 0.05$ and between $\Delta x = \numrange{7.7e-5}{7.9e-2}$.
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-16}
The simulation runs from $t_1 = 0$ to $t_1 = T = 10$, since the
multiple-scale expansion of \cref{sec:boussinesq} is only accurate for
times of order $\order{1/\epsilon}$.
\end{LineLabel}
Adaptive timestepping is employed such that the CFL number is $(\Delta
t) \max(\eta)/(\Delta x) = 1$.
For the unforced case, this corresponds to $\Delta t \approx
\num{7.86e-3}$, increases to \num{1.04e-2} for $P=-0.25$ and
decreases to \num{4.73e-4} for $P = 0.25$.
We found that linearly ramping up $P$ from $0$ at $t_1=0$ to its full
value at $t_1 = \epsilon$, or full, dimensional time $T_0 = 1/(\sqrt{gh}
k_E)$ (\ie{} the time required to cross the inverse, effective
wavenumber $1/k_E$, or `wave-crossing time') did not qualitatively
modify the results, so we do not utilize such a ramp-up here.
The spectral solver results in high numerical accuracy, with the
normalized root-mean-square difference between the unforced ($P=0$)
profile $\eta$ at $t'_1=10$ and the initial condition $\eta_0$ is
\num{2e-13}, and the normalized wave height change is
$1-\bqty{\max(\eta) - \min(\eta)}/\allowbreak\bqty{\max(\eta_0) -
\min(\eta_0)} = \num{-1e-13}$.
\end{LineLabel}

We quantify the wave shape with the wave's energy $E$, skewness $\Sk$
and asymmetry $\As$,
\begin{equation}
  E \coloneqq \langle \eta^2 \rangle \,, \quad
  \Sk \coloneqq \frac{\langle \eta^3 \rangle}{\langle \eta^2
  \rangle^{3/2}} \
  \qq{and}
  \As \coloneqq \frac{\langle \hilbert \Bqty{\eta^3} \rangle}{\langle
    \eta^2 \rangle^{3/2}}
  \,, \qq{with}
  \langle f \rangle \coloneqq \frac{1}{L} \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} f
  \dd{x} \,.
  \label{eq:shape_stats_def}
\end{equation}
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-12}
Here, $\hilbert(f)$ is the Hilbert transform of $f$, defined as the
imaginary part of $\fourier^{-1} \pqty{ \fourier \pqty{f} 2U}$ with $U$
the unit step function and $\fourier$ the Fourier transform.
\end{LineLabel}
Since these definitions depend on the domain size $L$, we normalize the
energy $E$ and skewness $\Sk$ by their initial values.

\section{\label{sec:results} Results}
We study the pressure magnitude's effect on solitary
wave evolution and shape by varying the KdV-Burgers equation's
\cref{eq:kdv_burgers} one free parameter, $P k_E/(\rho_w g \epsilon)$,
with emphasis on the contrast between onshore ($P > 0$) and offshore
wind ($P < 0$).
We revert to denoting non-dimensional variables with primes and
dimensional ones without.

    The arrows denote the wave propagation (phase speed) and wind
    direction.
  }\label{fig:snapshots_solitary}
\end{figure}

The wave profile $\eta/h$ snapshots in \cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}
qualitatively show how the wave shape evolves over non-dimensional slow
time $t'_1 = t \epsilon \sqrt{g h} k_E$ in the unforced solitary wave's
frame.
The onshore wind generates wave growth, apparent at the wave
crest (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:a}), whereas the offshore wind causes
decay (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:b}).
The wind also changes the phase speed, with the wave's acceleration
(deceleration) under an onshore (onshore) wind visible by the advancing
(receding) of the crest.
This is expected due to the dependence of (unforced) solitary waves' phase
speed $c = H/2$ on the growing/decaying wave
height~\cite[\eg][]{mei2005nonlinear}.

\begin{LineLabel}{R1-2}
While the growth/decay and phase speed changes are well known results
\citep[\eg][]{miles1957generation,cavaleri1981wind}, our new
contribution is the wind-induced shape change.
\end{LineLabel}
Indeed, despite the wave starting from a symmetric, solitary-wave
initial condition, the wind induces a horizontal asymmetry in the wave
shape, particularly on the rear face ($x<0$) of the wave.
The offshore wind (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:b}) raises the
rear base of the wave (near $x/h = -5$) relative to its initial profile
(purple line), but the onshore wind (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:a})
depresses the rear face and forms a small depression below the still
water level at $t\epsilon \sqrt{gh} k_E=5$ (blue line) which widens and
deepens at $t\epsilon \sqrt{gh} k_E=10$ (green line).
Finally, the onshore wind (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:a})
increases the maximum wave-slope magnitude with time while the offshore
wind (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:b}) decreases it, though the windward
side of the wave becomes steeper than the leeward side for both winds
(up to \SI{8}{\percent} steeper for the time period shown).
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-17}
Though the equation is ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard, the smooth
solutions show that our solution is acceptable up to the current time
and thus we are justified in neglecting a regularization scheme.
\end{LineLabel}

\begin{LineLabel}{R1-6}
Since this connection between wind and shallow-water wave shape is new,
we will further examine the wind-induced wave asymmetry by fitting
$\eta$ to a reference solitary wave profile $\eta_{\text{ref}}$
\cref{eq:initial_condition}.
We do this by minimizing the $L_1$ difference between $\eta$ and
$\eta_{\text{ref}}$, yielding the reference height $H_{\text{ref}}(t_1)$
and peak location $x_{\text{ref}}(t_1)$.
\end{LineLabel}
The profile change is defined as $\Delta \eta(x) \coloneqq \eta -
\eta_{\text{ref}}$ and is shown as a function of the reference
wave-centered distance $\tilde{x} \coloneqq x - x_{\text{ref}}$ in
\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary_tail}.
Notice that the profile change begins near the front face of the wave
and has extrema for negative $\tilde{x}'$ but with opposite signs for
onshore and offshore winds.
Additionally, the magnitude of the extrema decay with distance in the
$-\tilde{x}$ direction.
Finally, note that the onshore (offshore) wind generates a small peak
(trough) at $\tilde{x} = 0$ and two small troughs (peaks) near
$\tilde{x}/h = \pm 3$, with the $\tilde{x}<0$ extrema larger than the
$\tilde{x}>0$ one.
\begin{LineLabel}{R1-3}
This is analogous to a dispersive tail, well-known in KdV-type
systems~\citep[\eg][]{hammack1974korteweg}, and its appearance here
helps explain the pressure-induced shape change (\cf{}
\cref{sec:physical_reason}).

\end{figure}

The effect of wind on wave shape is quantified by the time evolution of
wave shape statistics---energy, skewness and asymmetry---for onshore
and offshore wind~(\cref{fig:statistics_solitary}).
We plot all cases for initial steepness $\epsilon = 0.1$ up to slow time
$t \epsilon \sqrt{g h} k_E = 10$, corresponding to $10/\epsilon = 100$
wave-crossing times, $T_0 = 1/(\sqrt{gh} k_E)$.
The unforced case ($P=0$) displays constant shape statistics and zero
asymmetry, as expected.
The normalized energy $E/E_0$ shows different growth/decay rates:
the onshore wind ($P>0$) causes accelerating wave growth while the
offshore wind ($P<0$) causes slowing wave decay
(\cref{fig:statistics_solitary:a}).
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-4}
The energy of the unforced wave is virtually unchanged, with a
normalized energy change of $1-E/E_0 = \num{-1e-13}$ at $t'_1 = 10$.
\end{LineLabel}
The onshore (offshore) wind causes the wave to become more (less) skewed
over time, with the normalized skewness nearly symmetric about unity
with respect to $\pm P$.
Finally, the onshore wind causes a backwards tilt and negative asymmetry
while the offshore wind increases the asymmetry and causes a forward
tilt, which was also seen in \cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}.
Notice that $\abs{\As}$ is larger for onshore winds than offshore winds.
Since the definitions of the skewness and asymmetry are insensitive to
waveform scaling $\eta \to \lambda \eta$, this effect is not simply
caused by the wave's growth/decay.
Instead, the onshore wind generates a larger dispersive tail
(\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary_tail}), which is the asymmetric wave
component.

\section{\label{sec:discussion} Discussion}

\subsection{\label{sec:press_mag} Wind speed estimation}
We now relate the non-dimensional pressure magnitude $P k_E/(\rho_w g) =
\order{\epsilon}$ to the wind speed.
First, we need a relationship between the surface pressure and wave
energy $E$ \cref{eq:shape_stats_def}, which we can approximate using the
standard procedure \citep[\eg][]{mei2005nonlinear} of multiplying the
(non-dimensional, denoted by primes) KdV-Burgers equation
\cref{eq:kdv_burgers} by $\eta'_0$ and integrating from $x'=-\infty$ to
$\infty$ to obtain
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{t'_1} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {\eta'}_0^2 \dd{x'}
  = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P' \pqty{\pdv{\eta'_0}{x'}}^2
  \dd{x'} \,.
  \label{eq:energy_nondim}
\end{equation}
The left integral is the non-dimensional energy
\cref{eq:shape_stats_def}, so re-dimensionalizing and converting back to
the full time $t$ gives the energy growth rate $\gamma$,
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-13}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\gamma}{c k_E} \coloneqq
  \frac{1}{c k_E E} \pdv{E}{t}
  = \frac{P k_E}{\rho_w g} \frac{\langle (\partial_x \eta)^2 \rangle}
    {\langle (k_E \eta)^2 \rangle}
  = \frac{1}{5} \frac{P k_E}{\rho_w g}
  \,,
  \label{eq:gamma_vs_P_solitary}
\end{equation}
with $c = \sqrt{gh}$ the phase speed and $\langle (\partial_x \eta)^2
\rangle / \langle (k_E \eta)^2 \rangle = 1/5$ evaluated with the
initial, solitary wave profile \cref{eq:initial_condition}.
\end{LineLabel}
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-14}
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-9}
Alternatively, a secondary multiple-scale approximation of the
forward KdV-Burgers equation has been used previously to derive
the energy growth rate for solitary waves as~\citep{zdyrski2019effects}
\end{LineLabel}
\begin{equation}
  E \propto \frac{1}{\pqty{1 - \gamma t}^2}
  \qq{with}
  \gamma \coloneqq b \bqty{\frac{P k_E}{\rho_w g}} c k_E
  \,,
  \label{eq:actual_energy}
\end{equation}
with analytically derived $b = 2/15$.
Numerically fitting \cref{eq:actual_energy} to our calculated energy
instead yields $b = \num{0.10081 \pm 0.00003}$, similar to the analytic
approximation.
\end{LineLabel}
Note that the exponential energy growth \cref{eq:gamma_vs_P_solitary}
correctly approximates \cref{eq:actual_energy} for small times $\gamma t
\ll 1$, and both expressions are consistent with the observed
accelerating (decelerating) energy change for $P>0$ ($P<0$) in
\cref{fig:statistics_solitary}.

Next, \citeauthor{jeffreys1925formation}'s
\citeyearpar{jeffreys1925formation} theory relates the growth rate of
periodic waves to the wind speed $U_{\lambda/2}$,
measured at a height equal to half the wavelength $z=\lambda/2$, as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\gamma}{c k} = S_{\lambda/2} \frac{\rho_a}{\rho_w}
    \pqty{\frac{U_{\lambda/2}}{c}-1}
    \abs{\frac{U_{\lambda/2}}{c}-1} \,,
  \label{eq:gamma_vs_u_jeffreys}
\end{equation}
with $S_{\lambda/2}$ a small, non-dimensional sheltering parameter
potentially dependent on $\epsilon$, $\mu_E$ and $U_{\lambda/2}/c$.
Combining this with \cref{eq:gamma_vs_P_solitary} gives
\begin{equation}
  U_{\lambda/2} = c \pqty{1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{5} \abs{\frac{P k_E}{\rho_w g}}
    \frac{\rho_w}{\rho_a} \frac{1}{S_{\lambda/2}}}} \,.
  \label{eq:U_vs_P}
\end{equation}
Here, the $\pm$ corresponds to onshore ($+$) or offshore ($-$) winds.
Note that changing the wind direction (\ie{} $\pm$ sign) while holding
the surface pressure magnitude $\abs{Pk_E/(\rho_w g)}$ constant means
onshore wind speeds $\abs{U_{\lambda/2}}$ will be larger than offshore
wind speeds.

We can evaluate \cref{eq:U_vs_P} for the parameters of
\cref{sec:results}: $\epsilon=0.1$, $\mu_E = 0.6$ and $Pk/(\rho_w g
\epsilon) = 0.25$.
\Citet{donelan2006wave} parameterized $S_{\lambda/2}$ for
periodic shallow-water waves with a dependence on airflow separation:
$S_{\lambda/2} = 4.91 \epsilon \sqrt{\mu}$ for our non-separated
flow (according to their criterion), with $\mu \coloneqq (kh)^2$.
Assuming this holds approximately for solitary waves, we choose $\lambda
= 2 \pi/k_E = \SI{20}{\meter}$ to calculate the wind speed at $z
= \lambda/2 = \SI{10}{\meter}$.
This choice corresponds to a depth of $h = \SI{2.5}{\meter}$ and initial
wave height $H_0 = \SI{0.5}{\meter}$ and yields a wind speed of $U_{10}
= \SI{22}{\meter\per\second}$, a physically realistic wind speed for
strongly forced shallow-water waves.
Weaker wind speeds will induce smaller surface pressures and thus take
longer to change the wave shape.

\subsection{\label{sec:physical_reason} Physical mechanism of asymmetry
generation}
Our initial, symmetric solitary waves \cref{eq:initial_condition} are
permanent-form solutions of the unforced KdV equation, so the pressure
forcing term in the KdV-Burgers equation is responsible for the wave
growth/decay and resultant shape changes and asymmetry, though not
directly.
Indeed, when the surface profile $\eta$ is symmetric, the pressure
forcing term $P \partial_x^2 \eta$ preserves the initial symmetry.
Instead, the pressure forcing causes a (symmetric) bound wave after a
short time $\Delta t'_1 \ll 1$, which can be seen by considering the
non-dimensional KdV-Burgers equation \cref{eq:kdv_burgers} in the
unforced solitary wave's frame (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}) at the
initial time,
\begin{align}
  &\eval{\pdv{\eta'_0}{t_1}}_{t'_1=0} = -P' \pdv[2]{x} \bqty{
  \sech^2\pqty{\frac{x'}{2}}}
  \\
  &\quad \implies \eta'_0(x', \Delta t'_1) =
  (2-P'\Delta t'_1) \sech^2\pqty{\frac{x'}{2}}
  +
  P' \Delta t'_1 \frac{3}{2}\sech^4\pqty{\frac{x'}{2}}
  \,.
  \label{eq:pressure_change}
\end{align}
The $P'\Delta t'_1$ terms generate a small peak (trough) at $x'=0$ and
small troughs (peaks) symmetrically in front and behind the wave peak
for onshore (offshore) wind, which are apparent near $\tilde{x}/h
\approx \pm 3$ in \cref{fig:snapshots_solitary_tail} but less
symmetrical since the times $t'_1 = 5$ and $10$ are not small.
The small numerical value $\abs{P'} = 0.25 \ll 1$ used in
\cref{sec:results} allows us to consider the wave's evolution as two
steps with time scale separation.
First, the pressure modifies the wave \cref{eq:pressure_change} on the
slow time scale, and then the wave evolves on a fast time scale from
this new profile according to unforced KdV evolution.
This evolution is described by the inverse scattering transform, which
shows that any localized, initial profile differing from
\cref{eq:initial_condition} will split into discrete solitary waves and
a bound, dispersive tail that decays behind ($x<0$) the wave
\citep[\eg][]{mei2005nonlinear}.
\begin{LineLabel}{R1-8}
Prior studies on shallow-water solitary waves have also noted that
bound, dispersive tail are ubiquitous, such as \figsname{} 8(b) and (c)
of \citet{hammack1974korteweg}.
\end{LineLabel}
Hence, the symmetric disturbance induced by the pressure forcing
\cref{eq:pressure_change} has two effects on the wave.
First, the wind slowly changes the height and width of the initial
solitary wave, which is reflected in the growth (decay) and narrowing
(widening) under onshore (offshore) winds in
\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}.
Second, it quickly generates an asymmetric, bound, dispersive tail
behind the wave (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary_tail}), producing a
greater shape change on the wave's rear face
(\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}).
Finally, the different wind directions (\ie{} pressure forcing signs)
change the sign of the bound, dispersive tail and, hence, the sign of
the asymmetry in \cref{fig:statistics_solitary}.

\subsection{Comparison to intermediate and deep water}
\Citet{zdyrski2020wind} investigated the effect of
wind on Stokes-like waves in intermediate to deep water.
This study, with wind coupled to waves in shallow water, finds
qualitative agreement with those intermediate- and deep-water results.
The shallow-water asymmetry magnitude increases as the pressure
magnitude $P$ increases~(\cref{fig:statistics_solitary}), and \figname{}
4(a) of \citet{zdyrski2020wind} displayed a similar trend for the
corresponding Jeffreys pressure profile, with positive (negative)
pressure increasing (decreasing) the asymmetry.
Although \citet{zdyrski2020wind} compared their theoretical
predictions to limited experimental results with $kh > 1$, there are no
appropriate experiments on wind-induced changes to wave shape in shallow
water for comparison with our results.
In addition to the Jeffreys pressure profile employed here,
\citet{zdyrski2020wind} also utilized a generalized Miles profile,
only applicable to periodic waves, wherein the pressure was proportional
to $\eta$ shifted by a distance parameter $\psi_P/k$.
Though this analysis focuses on solitary waves, we also investigated the
effect of wind on periodic waves using the cnoidal-wave KdV solutions as
initial conditions.
However, these were omitted for brevity.

\section{Conclusion}
Prior results~\citep{zdyrski2020wind} in intermediate and deep water
demonstrated that wind,
\begin{LineLabel}{R2-3}
acting through a wave-dependent surface pressure,
\end{LineLabel}
can generate shape changes that become more pronounced in
shallow water.
Here, we utilized a multiple-scale analysis to couple weak wind with
small, shallow-water waves, \ie{} $a_0/h \sim (k_E h)^2 \sim P k/(\rho_w
g) \ll 1$.
This gave a KdV-Burgers equation governing the wave profile $\eta$
which was solved numerically with a symmetric, solitary wave initial
condition.
The deviations between the numerical results and a reference solitary
wave had the form of a bound, dispersive tail, with differing signs for
onshore and offshore wind.
The tail's presence and shape are the result of a symmetric,
pressure-induced shape change evolving under the inverse scattering
transform.
We also estimated the energy, skewness and
asymmetry as functions of time and pressure magnitude.
For onshore wind (positive $P$), the wave's energy and skewness
increased with time while asymmetry decreased, while offshore wind
produced the opposite effects.
Furthermore, these effects were enhanced for strong pressures, and they
reduced to the unforced case for $P=0$.
The shape statistics found here show qualitative agreement with the
results in intermediate and deep water.
Finally, the wind speeds corresponding to these pressure differences
were calculated and found to be physically realistic.
