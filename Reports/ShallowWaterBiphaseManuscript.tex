\title{Wind-Induced Changes to Surface Gravity Wave Shape in Shallow Water}

\author{Thomas J. Zdyrski \and Falk Feddersen}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Wave shape (\eg{} wave skewness and asymmetry) impacts sediment
transport, remote sensing and ship safety.
Previous work by the authors showed that wind (via changes in surface
pressure) affects wave shape in intermediate and deep water, and this
effect was most pronounced as the depth decreased.
The current work investigates the interaction of wind and wave shape in
shallow water.
A multiple-scale analysis of long waves propagating over a shallow,
flat bottom and forced by a Jeffreys-type surface pressure produces a
Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)-Burgers equation governing the wave profile.
The evolution of an initially symmetric solitary wave is calculated
numerically.
The wave's energy, skewness and asymmetry are investigated as functions
of time and pressure magnitude.
These results are in qualitative agreement with prior results in
intermediate and deep water.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The study of wind and ocean wave interactions began with
\citet{jeffreys1925formation} and continues to be an active field of
research~\citep[\eg][]{janssen1991quasi,donelan2004limiting,sulivan2010dynamics}.
Many theoretical
studies~\citep[\eg][]{jeffreys1925formation,miles1957generation,phillips1957generation}
focus on calculating wind-induced growth rates and often employ
phase-averaging techniques.
However, wind can also influence wave shape, quantified by third-order
shape statistics such as skewness and asymmetry, corresponding to
vertical and horizontal asymmetry,
respectively~\citep[\eg][]{leykin1995asymmetry,feddersen2005wind,zdyrski2020wind}.
Wave shape influences sediment transport and modulates beach
morphodynamics~\citep[\eg][]{drake2001discrete,hoefel2003wave}, while
wave skewness affects radar altimetry
signals~\citep[\eg][]{hayne1980radar} and asymmetry modulates ship
responses to wave impacts~\citep[\eg][]{soares2008abnormal}.

Waves in shallow water, where $kh \ll 1$ (with $h$ the water depth and
$k=2\pi/\lambda$ the wavenumber), differ qualitatively from those in
intermediate to deep water where $kh \sim 1$ or $\gg 1$, respectively.
For waves with amplitudes $a_0 \ll h$,
leveraging the small parameters $a/h \sim (kh)^2 \ll 1$
yields the Boussinesq equations with weak dispersion and nonlinearity.
A special class of waves formed when dispersion balances nonlinear
focusing are known as solitary waves and have appeared in environments
ranging from nonlinear optical pulses \citep[\eg][]{kivshar1993dark} to
astrophysical dusty plasmas \citep[\eg][]{sahu2012nonextensive}.
One of the simplest equations displaying solitary waves is the
Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, which incorporates dispersion and
nonlinearity.
When augmented with a dissipative term, this becomes the KdV-Burgers
equation, with applications to damped internal tides
\citep[\eg][]{sandstrom1995dissipation}, electron waves in graphene
\citep[\eg][]{zdyrski2019effects} and viscous flow in blood vessels
\citep[\eg][]{antar1999weakly}.
To investigate wind and surface wave interactions in shallow water, we
introduce a wind-induced pressure term to the Boussinesq equations in
\cref{sec:derivation}.
The resulting KdV-Burgers equation governs a solitary wave's evolution,
which we solve numerically to yield the wave energy, skewness and
asymmetry in \cref{sec:results}.
Finally, we calculate wind speeds, discuss the asymmetry's cause and
compare our results to intermediate- and deep-water waves in
\cref{sec:discussion}.

\section{\label{sec:derivation} Derivation of KdV-Burgers equation}

\subsection{Governing equations}
We will treat the flow as irrotational and inviscid and neglect surface
tension by considering length scales much greater than
\SI{2}{\centi\meter}.
Furthermore, we restrict to planar wave propagation in the $+x$
direction.
Finally, we choose a coordinate system with $z=0$ at the mean water
level and a horizontal, flat bottom located at $z=-h$.
Then, the incompressibility condition and standard boundary conditions
are
\begin{alignat}{2}
  0 &= \phi_{xx} + \phi_{zz} &&\qq{on}
  -h < z < \eta \,, \label{eq:laplace}\\
  0 &= \phi_{z} &&\qq{on} z=-h \,, \label{eq:bottom_bc}\\
  \phi_{z} &= \eta_{t} + \phi_{x} \eta_{x} &&\qq{on} z = \eta \,,
  \label{eq:kinematic_bc}\\
  0 &= \frac{p}{\rho_w} + g\eta + \phi_{t} +
  \frac{1}{2} \bqty{\phi_{x}^2 + \phi_{z}^2} &&\qq{on} z=
  \eta \,. \label{eq:dynamic_bc}
\end{alignat}
Here, $\eta(x,t)$ is the wave profile, $\phi(x,z,t)$ is the flow's
velocity potential related to the velocity $\vec{u} = \grad{\phi}$,
$p(x,t)$ is the surface pressure, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration
and $\rho_w$ is the water density.
We used $\phi$'s gauge freedom to absorb the Bernoulli `constant'
$C(t)$ in the dynamic boundary condition.
We are seeking a solitary, progressive wave which decays at infinity,
$\eta(\vec{x},t) \to 0$ as $\abs{\vec{x}} \to \infty$, with similar
conditions on $\vec{u}$.
We choose a coordinate system where the average bottom horizontal
velocity vanishes,
\begin{equation}
  \overline{ \pdv{\phi}{x} } = 0 \qq{on} z=-h \,,
  \label{eq:bot_bc_horz}
\end{equation}
with the overline a spatial average $\overline{f} \coloneqq
\lim_{L\to\infty} \int_{-L}^{L} f \dd{x} / (2L)$.
Additionally, we assume the surface pressure $p(x,t)$ is a Jeffreys-type
forcing \citep{jeffreys1925formation},
\begin{equation}
  p(x,t) = P \pdv{\eta(x,t)}{x} \,.
\end{equation}
Here, $P$ is proportional to $(U-c)^2$, with $c$ the phase speed and $U$
the wind speed (\cf{} \cref{sec:press_mag}), and $P>0$ corresponds to
(`onshore') wind in the same direction as the wave while $P<0$ denotes
(`offshore') wind opposite the wave.
We use a Jeffreys forcing for its analytic simplicity and clear
demonstration of wind-wave coupling.
Though Jeffrey's separated sheltering mechanism is likely only relevant
in special situations (\eg{} near breaking,
\citealp{banner1976separation}, or for steep waves under strong winds,
\citealp{tian2013evolution,touboul2006interaction}),
a fully dynamic coupling between wind and waves---necessary for an
accurate surface pressure over a non-sinusoidal, dynamic water
surface---is outside the scope of this paper.

\subsection{\label{sec:nondim} Non-dimensionalization}
We non-dimensionalize our system with the known characteristic
scales: the horizontal length scale $L$ over which $\eta$ changes
rapidly, expressed as an effective wavenumber $k_E \coloneqq 2 \pi/L$;
the (initial) wave amplitude $a_0 = H_0/2$ (\ie{} half the wave height
$H_0$); the depth $h$; the gravitational acceleration $g$; and the wind
speed $U$, expressed as a pressure magnitude $P \propto \rho_a (U-c)^2$.
Denoting non-dimensional variables with primes, we have
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  x &= \frac{x'}{k_E} = h \frac{x'}{\sqrt{\mu_E}}\,, \\
  z &= h z' \,,
  \end{aligned}
  \qquad
  \begin{aligned}
  t &= \frac{t'}{k_E\sqrt{g h}}
    = \frac{t'}{\sqrt{\mu_E}} \sqrt{\frac{h}{g}} \,, \\
  P &= \epsilon P' \frac{\rho_w g}{k_E}
    = \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{\mu_E}} P' \rho_w g h \,,
  \end{aligned}
  \qquad
  \begin{aligned}
  \eta &= a_0 \eta' = h \epsilon \eta' \,, \\
  \phi &= \phi'\frac{a_0}{k_E}\sqrt{\frac{g}{h}}
    = \frac{\phi'\epsilon}{\sqrt{\mu_E}}\sqrt{g h^3} \,.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Our system's dynamics are controlled by three small, non-dimensional
parameters: $\epsilon \coloneqq a_0/h$, $\mu_E \coloneqq (k_E h)^2$ and
$P k_E/(\rho_w g)$.
We will later require $\order{\epsilon} = \order{\mu_E} =
\order{Pk_E/(\rho_w g)}$.
Now, our non-dimensional equations take the form
\begin{alignat}{2}
  0 &= \mu_E \phi'_{x'x'} + \phi'_{z'z'} &&\qq{on}
    -1 < z' < \epsilon \eta' \,, \label{eq:laplace_nondim} \\
  0 &= \phi'_{z'} &&\qq{on} z'=-1 \,, \label{eq:bottom_bc_nondim} \\
  \phi'_{z'} &= \mu_E \eta'_{t'} +
    \epsilon \mu_E \phi'_{x'} \eta'_{x'} &&\qq{on} z' = \epsilon \eta' \,,
    \label{eq:kinematic_bc_nondim} \\
  0 &= \epsilon P' \eta'_{x'} +  \eta' + \phi'_{t'} + \frac{1}{2}
    \pqty{\epsilon \phi_{x'}^{\prime \, 2} + \frac{\epsilon}{\mu_E}
    \phi_{z'}^{\prime \, 2}} &&\qq{on} z'= \epsilon \eta' \,.
    \label{eq:dynamic_bc_nondim}
\end{alignat}
This is equivalent to choosing units where $h = g = \rho_w = 1$.
We will drop the primes henceforth for readability.

\subsection{Boussinesq equation, multiple-scale expansion, and KdV
equation}
Here, we modify the Boussinesq equation's derivation provided by
\citet{mei2005nonlinear} by including the surface pressure forcing in
\cref{eq:dynamic_bc}.
First we Taylor expand the velocity potential $\phi$ about the bottom,
$z=-1$,
\begin{equation}
  \phi(x,y,z,t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (z+1)^n\phi_n(x,y,t) \,.
\end{equation}
Then, a standard calculation \citep[\eg][]{mei2005nonlinear} using
Laplace's equation \cref{eq:laplace_nondim} and the bottom boundary
condition \cref{eq:bottom_bc_nondim} yields an expansion of $\phi$ in
terms of $\mu_E \ll 1$,
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \phi_0 - \frac{1}{2}\mu_E (z+1)^2\partial^2_x\phi_0 +
  \frac{\mu_E^2}{24}(z+1)^4\partial^4_x\phi_0 +
  \order{\mu_E^3} \,.
\end{equation}
For convenience, we define $\varphi \coloneqq \phi_0$.
Substituting this expansion into the two remaining boundary equations,
\cref{eq:kinematic_bc_nondim,eq:dynamic_bc_nondim}, and recalling that
they are evaluated at $z=\epsilon \eta$, we have reduced our system to
the Boussinesq equations with a pressure forcing term,
\begin{gather}
  \partial_t \eta + \partial_x^2 \varphi + \epsilon \partial_x
    \pqty{\eta \partial_x \varphi} -\frac{1}{6}\mu_E \partial^4_x
    \varphi = \order{\mu_E^2} \label{eq:kinematic_bc_varphi} \,, \\
  \partial_t \varphi + \epsilon P \partial_x \eta + \eta -
    \frac{1}{2}\mu_E \partial_t \partial_x^2 \varphi +
    \frac{1}{2}\epsilon\pqty{\partial_x \varphi}^2 = \order{\mu_E^2} \,.
    \label{eq:dynamic_bc_varphi}
\end{gather}
Further, we will now assume $\order{\epsilon} = \order{\mu_E} \ll 1$.

We now expand $t$ using multiple time scales $t_n =
\epsilon^n t$ for $n= 0,1$, so all time derivatives become $\partial_t \to
\partial_{t_0} + \epsilon \partial_{t_1}$.
Then, we write $\eta$ and $\varphi$ in asymptotic series of $\epsilon$,
\begin{equation}
  \eta(x,t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \epsilon^k
    \eta_{k+1}(x,t_0,t_1) \qq{and}
  \varphi(x,t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \epsilon^k
    \varphi_{k+1}(x,t_0,t_1,) \,.
\end{equation}
Now, we will reduce the Boussinesq equations,
\cref{eq:kinematic_bc_varphi,eq:dynamic_bc_varphi}, to the KdV equation
following a similar method to \citet{mei2005nonlinear}.
Collecting order-one terms $\order{\epsilon^0}$ from
\cref{eq:kinematic_bc_varphi,eq:dynamic_bc_varphi} gives
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{\eta_0}{t_0} + \pdv[2]{\varphi_0}{x} = 0 \qq{and}
  \eta_0 + \pdv{\varphi_0}{t_0} = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
These shallow-water wave equations have left- and right-moving wave
solutions.
Restricting to right-moving waves gives
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_0 = f_0(x-t_0,t_1) \qq{and}
  \eta_0 = f'_0(x-t_0,1) \qq{with}
  f_0' \coloneqq \eval{\pdv{f_0(\theta,t_1)}{\theta}}_{\theta = x-t_0} \,.
\end{equation}

Continuing to the next order of perturbation theory, we retain terms of
order $\order{\epsilon}$,
\begin{gather}
    \pdv{\eta_1}{t_0} + \pdv[2]{\varphi_{1}}{x} =
      -\pdv{\eta_0}{t_1} - \pdv{x} \pqty{\eta_0 \pdv{\varphi_0}{x}} +
      \frac{1}{6} \frac{\mu_E}{\epsilon} \pdv[4]{\varphi_0}{x} \,,
  \\
    \eta_1 + \pdv{\varphi_1}{t_0} = -P \pdv{\eta_0}{x} -\pdv{\varphi_0}{t_1}
      + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\mu_E}{\epsilon} \frac{\partial^3 \varphi_0}
        {\partial t_0 \partial^2 x}
      - \frac{1}{2} \pqty{ \pdv{\varphi_0}{x} }^2
  \,.
\end{gather}
Inserting our leading order solutions for $\eta_0$ and $\varphi_0$ while
eliminating $\eta_1$ gives
\begin{equation}
  \pqty{\pdv[2]{x} - \pdv[2]{t_0}} \varphi_1 = -2 \pdv{f_0'}{t_1} +
    P\pdv{\eta_0}{t_0}{x} - 3 f_0' f_0'' - \frac{1}{3} \frac{\mu_E}{\epsilon}
    f_0^{(4)} \,.
\end{equation}
The homogeneous equation is again the shallow-water wave equation for
$\varphi_1$.
Since the right-hand side is a resonant forcing, it must vanish.
Thus, converting back to $\eta_0$ gives the Korteweg-de Vries
(KdV)-Burgers equation,
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{\eta_0}{t_1} + \frac{3}{2}
    \eta_0 \pdv{\eta_0}{x} + \frac{1}{6} \frac{\mu_E}{\epsilon}
    \pdv[3]{\eta_0}{x} = -P \frac{1}{2} \pdv[2]{\eta_0}{x} \,.
  \label{eq:kdv_burgers}
\end{equation}
The pressure term, $P \partial^2_x \eta_0$, acts as a positive viscosity
for offshore, damping wind or a negative viscosity when onshore wind
causes wave growth.
Note that \cref{eq:kdv_burgers} has a rescaling symmetry, with $\mu_E
\to \lambda^2 \mu_E$ equivalent to taking $(x,t_0,t_1,P) \to
(x,t_0,t_1,P)/\lambda$.
Therefore, we fix the length scale (equivalently, $k_E$) by choosing
$\mu_E = 6 \epsilon$.
The KdV-Burgers equation is not known to have any closed form solutions,
so we will instead solve it numerically.

\subsection{\label{sec:initial} Initial condition}
For the initial condition, we use solitary wave solutions of the unforced
($P=0$) KdV equation \citep[\eg][]{mei2005nonlinear},
\begin{equation}
  \eta_0 = H_0 \sech^2\pqty{\frac{x - c_1 t_1}{\Delta}}
  \qq{with}
  \Delta = \sqrt{\frac{8}{H_0}}
  \qq{and}
  c_1 = \frac{H_0}{2} \,,
  \label{eq:initial_condition}
\end{equation}
with $H_0>0$ an order-1 parameter.
Thus, our initial condition is \cref{eq:initial_condition} with $t_1=0$.
We now choose $H_0 = 2$ so that our characteristic initial amplitude
$a_0 = H_0/2$ is unity (\cf{} \cref{sec:nondim}).
The solitary wave solution of the unforced KdV equation balances
dispersion $\partial_x^3 \eta_0$ with focusing nonlinearity $\eta_0
\partial_x \eta_0$; the introduction of a dissipative term $P
\partial_x^2 \eta_0$ will disrupt this balance, inducing shape changes
and growth or decay.

\subsection{Numerics and shape statistics}
To solve \cref{eq:kdv_burgers} numerically,
we will use a spatial domain with periodic boundary conditions and $N_x
= 1600$ points spread over a domain of length $L = 80$.
This yields a spacing $\Delta x = 0.05$, with $x = 0, \Delta x,
2\Delta x, \ldots L - \Delta x$.
The simulation runs from $t_1 = 0$ to $t_1 = T = 3$, inclusive, with
$N_t = \num{4.8e5}$ points, yielding a spacing $\Delta t_1 = T/(N_t-1)
\approx \num{6.25e-6}$.
We found that linearly ramping up $P$ from $0$ at $t_1=0$ to its full
value at $t_1 = \epsilon$, or full, dimensional time $t = \sqrt{gh} k_E$
(\ie{} the time required to cross the effective wavelength $2\pi/k_E$,
or `wave-crossing time') did not qualitatively modify the results, so we
do not utilize such a ramp-up here.

We discretize \cref{eq:kdv_burgers} in space using a
second-order central finite difference method and in time using a
third-order Runge-Kutta scheme.
For numerical stability, we must also include a hyperviscosity term,
$-\nu_{\text{bi}} \partial_x^4 \eta_0$ with $\nu_{\text{bi}} =
\num{3e-3}$, on the right-hand side of \cref{eq:kdv_burgers}.
This hyperviscosity does not noticeably affect the wave; the normalized
root-mean-square difference between the unforced ($P=0$) profile $\eta$
at $t'_1=3$ and the initial condition $\eta_0$ is $\sqrt{\langle (\eta -
\eta_0)^2 \rangle/ \langle \eta_0^2 \rangle} = \num{2e-3}$.
We quantify the wave shape with the wave energy $E$, skewness $\Sk$ and
asymmetry $\As$,
\begin{equation}
  E \coloneqq \langle \eta^2 \rangle \,, \qquad
  \Sk \coloneqq \frac{\langle \eta^3 \rangle}{\langle \eta^2
  \rangle^{3/2}} \
  \qq{and}
  \As \coloneqq \frac{\langle \hilbert \Bqty{\eta^3} \rangle}{\langle
    \eta^2 \rangle^{3/2}}
  \,, \qq{with}
  \langle f \rangle \coloneqq \frac{1}{L} \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} f
  \dd{x} \,.
  \label{eq:shape_stats_def}
\end{equation}
Here, $\hilbert$ is the Hilbert transform.
Since these definitions depend on the domain size $L$, we normalize the
energy $E$ and skewness $\Sk$ by their initial values.
Though this analysis focuses on solitary waves, we also investigated the
effect of wind on periodic waves using the cnoidal-wave KdV solutions as
initial conditions.
The pressure-induced shape statistics were qualitatively similar to
those derived for solitary waves and are omitted for brevity.

\section{\label{sec:results} Results}
We examine the effect of different pressure magnitudes in the
KdV-Burgers equation \cref{eq:kdv_burgers} on solitary wave evolution
and shape by varying the one free parameter, $P k_E/(\rho_w g
\epsilon)$, with particular emphasis on the contrast between onshore ($P
> 0$) and offshore wind ($P < 0$).
We revert to dimensional variables and denote non-dimensional ones with
primes.

    $1.5$ and $3$, as indicated in the legend.

    direction.
  }\label{fig:snapshots_solitary}
\end{figure}

The wave profile $\eta/h$ snapshots in \cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}
qualitatively show how the wave shape evolves over non-dimensional slow
time $t'_1 = t \epsilon \sqrt{g h} k_E$ when plotted against the
non-dimensional distance $x/h$ in the unforced solitary wave's frame.
First, the onshore wind generates accelerating wave growth, apparent at
the wave crest $x=0$ (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:a}), while the
onshore wind causes decelerating wave decay
(\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:b}).
The wind also slightly changes the phase speed, with the wave's
acceleration (deceleration) under an onshore (onshore) wind visible by
the slight advancing (receding) of the crest.
This is expected due to the phase speed's dependence on the
growing/decaying wave height \cref{eq:initial_condition}.
Additionally, despite the wave starting from a symmetric, solitary-wave
initial condition, the wind induces a horizontal asymmetry in the wave
shape, particularly on the rear face ($x<0$) of the wave.
The offshore wind (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:b}) raises the
rear base of the wave (near $x/h = -6$) relative to its initial profile
(purple line), but the onshore wind (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:a})
depresses it and forms a small depression below the still water level at
$t\epsilon \sqrt{gh} k_E=3$ (green line).
Additionally, the onshore wind (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:a})
increases the maximum wave-slope magnitude with time while the offshore
wind (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary:b}) decreases it, though the windward
side of the wave becomes steeper than the leeward side for both winds
(up to \SI{8}{\percent} steeper for the time period shown).

\end{figure}

The wave profile $\eta$ is dominated by the symmetric, $\sech^2$
solitary wave, but we can subtract off this component to emphasize the
asymmetric remainder.
We calculate the $\sech^2$ profile's height $H'(t'_1)$ and center
location $x'_{\text{center}}(t'_1)$ using a least-absolute-deviation fit
to leverage the cancellation of the oscillatory remainder.
After boosting to a frame centered on the $\sech^2$, solitary wave
$\tilde{x}' \coloneqq (x'-x'_{\text{center}})$, we subtract the solitary
wave of the appropriate height from the profile $\eta$,
\begin{equation}
  \Delta \eta'(\tilde{x}') \coloneqq \eta'(\tilde{x}')
  - H'(t'_1) \sech^2\pqty{\frac{\tilde{x}'}{\Delta'}}
  \qq{with}
  \Delta' = \sqrt{\frac{8}{H'(t'_1)}} \,.
  \label{eq:profile_discrepancy}
\end{equation}
This difference is shown in \cref{fig:snapshots_solitary_tail}.
Notice that the tail begins near the front face of the wave and decays
with distance behind the wave.
Prior studies on shallow-water solitary waves have also noted this
oscillatory tail, such as \figsname{} 8(b) and (c)
of \citet{hammack1974korteweg}.
The oscillatory tail of solitary waves is a ubiquitous phenomenon for
KdV systems \citep[\eg{}][]{mei2005nonlinear}, so it is unsurprising to
find it here as well.

The effect of wind on wave shape is quantified by the time evolution of
wave shape statistics---energy, skewness and asymmetry---for onshore
wind, offshore wind, and unforced ($P=0$) cases
(\cref{fig:statistics_solitary}).
We plot all cases for initial steepness $\epsilon = 0.1$ up to slow time
$t \epsilon \sqrt{g h} k_E = 3$, corresponding to $3/\epsilon = 30$
wave-crossing times, $\sqrt{gh} k_E$.
The normalized energy $E/E_0$ shows an asymmetry in growth/decay rates:
the onshore wind ($P>0$) causes accelerating wave growth while the
offshore wind ($P<0$) causes slowing wave decay
(\cref{fig:statistics_solitary:a}), which was also visible in the crest
growth/decay of \cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}.
The onshore (offshore) wind causes the wave to become more (less) skewed
over time, with the normalized skewness nearly symmetric about unity
with respect to $\pm P$.
Finally, the onshore wind causes a backwards tilt and negative asymmetry
while the offshore wind increases the asymmetry and causes the wave to
tilt forwards, which was also seen in \cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}.
Notice that $\abs{\As}$ is larger for onshore winds than offshore winds.
Since the definitions of the skewness and asymmetry are insensitive to
waveform scaling $\eta \to \lambda \eta$, this effect is not simply
caused by the wave's growth/decay.
Instead, the onshore wind generates a larger oscillatory tail
(\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary_tail}), which is the asymmetric wave
component.

\section{\label{sec:discussion} Discussion}

\subsection{\label{sec:press_mag} Wind speed estimation}
We now relate the non-dimensional pressure magnitude $P k_E/(\rho_w g) =
\order{\epsilon}$ to the wind speed.
First, we need a relationship between the surface pressure and wave
energy $E$ \cref{eq:shape_stats_def}, which we can approximate using the
standard procedure \citep[\eg][]{mei2005nonlinear} of multiplying the
(non-dimensional, denoted by primes) KdV-Burgers equation
\cref{eq:kdv_burgers} by $\eta'_0$ and integrating from $x'=-\infty$ to
$\infty$ to obtain
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{t'_1} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {\eta'}_0^2 \dd{x'}
  = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P' \pqty{\pdv{\eta'_0}{x'}}^2
  \dd{x'} \,.
\end{equation}
The left integral is the non-dimensional energy
\cref{eq:shape_stats_def}, so re-dimensionalizing and converting back to
the full time $t$ gives the energy growth rate $\gamma$,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\gamma}{c k_E} \coloneqq
  \frac{1}{c k_E E} \pdv{E}{t}
  = \frac{P k_E}{\rho_w g} \frac{\langle (\partial_x \eta)^2 \rangle}
    {\langle (k_E \eta)^2 \rangle}
  = \frac{1}{5} \frac{P k_E}{\rho_w g}
  \,,
  \label{eq:gamma_vs_P_solitary}
\end{equation}
with $c = \sqrt{gh}$ the phase speed and the angle brackets evaluated
with the initial, solitary wave profile \cref{eq:initial_condition}.
Alternatively, we can numerically fit the energy growth rate to
\begin{equation}
  E \propto \frac{1}{\pqty{1 - \gamma t}^2}
  \qq{with}
  \gamma \coloneqq b \bqty{\frac{P k_E}{\rho_w g}} c k_E
  \,,
  \label{eq:actual_energy}
\end{equation}
with $b = \num{0.10000 \pm 0.00009}$.
\Cref{eq:actual_energy} has the same functional form and similar
growth rate $\gamma = (2/15) (P k_E/\rho_w g \epsilon) ck$ to that
derived by \citet{zdyrski2019effects} for solitary waves using a
secondary multiple-scale approximation of the KdV-Burgers equation.
Note that the exponential energy growth \cref{eq:gamma_vs_P_solitary}
correctly approximates the rational energy growth
\cref{eq:actual_energy} for small times $\gamma t \ll 1$,
and both expressions are consistent with the observed accelerating
(decelerating) energy change for $P>0$ ($P<0$) in
\cref{fig:statistics_solitary}.

Next, \citeauthor{jeffreys1925formation}'s
\citeyearpar{jeffreys1925formation} theory relates the growth rate of
periodic waves to the wind speed $U_z$ (the subscript giving the
measurement height $z$) as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\gamma}{c k} = S_z \frac{\rho_a}{\rho_w}
    \pqty{\frac{U_z}{c}-1} \abs{\frac{U_z}{c}-1} \,,
  \label{eq:gamma_vs_u_jeffreys}
\end{equation}
with $S_z$ a small, non-dimensional sheltering parameter potentially
dependent on $\epsilon$, $\mu_E$ and $U_z/c$.
Combining this with \cref{eq:gamma_vs_P_solitary} gives
\begin{equation}
  U_z = c \pqty{1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{5} \abs{\frac{P k_E}{\rho_w g}}
    \frac{\rho_w}{\rho_a} \frac{1}{S_z}}} \,.
  \label{eq:U_vs_P}
\end{equation}
Here, the $\pm$ corresponds to onshore ($+$) or offshore ($-$) winds.
Note that changing the wind direction (\ie{} $\pm$ sign) while holding
the surface pressure magnitude $\abs{Pk_E/(\rho_w g)}$ constant means
onshore wind speeds $\abs{U_z}$ will be larger than offshore wind speeds
$\abs{U_z}$.

We can evaluate \cref{eq:U_vs_P} for the parameters of
\cref{sec:results}: $\epsilon=0.1$, $\mu_E = 0.6$ and $Pk/(\rho_w g
\epsilon) = 0.25$.
\Citet{donelan2006wave} parameterized $S_z$ for
periodic shallow-water waves with a dependence on airflow separation:
$S_{\lambda/2} = 4.91 \epsilon \sqrt{\mu}$ for our non-separated
flow (according to their criterion), with $U_z$ measured at
$z=\lambda/2$ and $\mu \coloneqq (kh)^2$.
Assuming this holds approximately for solitary waves, we choose $\lambda
= 2 \pi/k_E = \SI{20}{\meter}$ to calculate the wind speed at $z
= \lambda/2 = \SI{10}{\meter}$.
This choice corresponds to a depth of $h = \SI{2.5}{\meter}$ and initial
wave height $H_0 = \SI{0.5}{\meter}$ and yields a wind speed of $U_{10}
= \SI{21}{\meter\per\second}$, a physically realistic wind speed for
strongly forced shallow-water waves.
Furthermore, weaker wind speeds will induce smaller surface pressures
and thus take longer to change the wave shape.

\subsection{\label{sec:physical_reason} Cause of asymmetry}
Our initial, symmetric solitary waves \cref{eq:initial_condition} are
permanent-form solutions of the unforced KdV equation, so the pressure
forcing term in the KdV-Burgers equation is responsible for the
resultant shape changes and asymmetry, though not directly.
Indeed, when the surface profile $\eta$ is symmetric, then the pressure
forcing term $P \partial_x^2 \eta$ preserves this symmetry.
Instead, the pressure forcing causes a (symmetric) bound wave after a
short time $\Delta t'_1 \ll 1$, which can be seen by considering the
non-dimensional KdV-Burgers equation \cref{eq:kdv_burgers} in the
unforced solitary wave's frame (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}) at the
initial time,
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  &\eval{\pdv{\eta'_0}{t_1}}_{t'_1=0} = -P' \pdv[2]{x} \bqty{
  \sech^2\pqty{\frac{x'}{2}}}
  \\
  &\qquad \implies \eta'_0(x', \Delta t'_1) =
  (2-P'\Delta t'_1) \sech^2\pqty{\frac{x'}{2}}
  +
  P' \Delta t'_1 \frac{3}{2}\sech^4\pqty{\frac{x'}{2}}
  \,.
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:pressure_change}
\end{equation}
The numerical value $\abs{P'} = 0.25$ used in \cref{sec:results} was
moderately small, so we can consider the wave's evolution as two steps
with time scale separation.
First, the pressure adiabatically modifies the wave
\cref{eq:pressure_change}, and then the wave quickly evolves from this
new profile according to unforced KdV evolution.
This evolution is described by the inverse scattering transform, which
shows that any localized, initial profile differing from
\cref{eq:initial_condition} will split into discrete solitary waves and
an oscillatory tail that decays behind ($x<0$) the wave
\citep[\eg][]{mei2005nonlinear}.
Hence, the symmetric disturbance induced by the pressure forcing
\cref{eq:pressure_change} has two effects on the wave.
First, it adiabatically changes the height and width of the initial
solitary wave, which is reflected in the growth (decay) and narrowing
(widening) under onshore (offshore) winds in
\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}.
Second, it generates an asymmetric, oscillatory tail behind
the wave (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary_tail}), producing a greater shape
change on the wave's rear face (\cref{fig:snapshots_solitary}).
Finally, the different wind directions (\ie{} pressure forcing signs)
change the sign of the oscillatory tail and, hence, the sign of the
asymmetry in \cref{fig:statistics_solitary}.

\subsection{Comparison to intermediate and deep water}
A previous study \citep{zdyrski2020wind} investigated the effect of
wind on Stokes-like waves in intermediate to deep water.
This study, with wind coupled to waves in shallow water, finds
qualitative agreement with those intermediate- and deep-water results.
The shallow-water asymmetry magnitude increases as the pressure
magnitude $P$ increases~(\cref{fig:statistics_solitary}), and \figname{}
4(a) of \citet{zdyrski2020wind} displayed a similar trend for the
corresponding Jeffreys pressure profile, with positive (negative)
pressure increasing (decreasing) the asymmetry.
In addition to the Jeffreys pressure profile employed here,
\citet{zdyrski2020wind} also utilized a Generalized Miles (GM) profile
wherein the pressure was proportional to $\eta$ shifted by a distance
parameter $\psi_P/k$, which is most suitable for periodic waves.
However, results for GM forcings were not included here since the GM
forcing gives rise to a nonlocal KdV equation and produces unphysical
effects such as the growth of higher harmonics under damping, offshore
winds.
Finally, while \citet{zdyrski2020wind} compared their theoretical
predictions to limited experimental results with $kh > 1$, there are no
appropriate experiments on wind-induced changes to wave shape in shallow
water for comparison with our results.

\section{Conclusion}
Prior results~\citep{zdyrski2020wind} in intermediate and deep water
demonstrated that wind, acting though a wave-dependent surface
pressure, can generate shape changes that become more pronounced in
shallow water.
Here, we utilized a multiple-scale analysis to couple weak wind with
small, shallow-water waves, \ie{} $a_0/h \sim (k_E h)^2 \sim P k/(\rho_w
g) \ll 1$, leading to a KdV-Burgers equation governing the wave profile
$\eta$.
We utilized a symmetric, solitary wave satisfying the unforced KdV
equation as our initial condition.
A third-order Runge Kutta solver determined the time-evolution of the
surface profile, and we extracted energy, skewness and asymmetry as
functions of time and pressure magnitude.
For onshore wind (positive $P$), wave energy and skewness increased with
time while asymmetry decreased, while offshore wind produced opposite
effects.
Furthermore, these effects were enhanced for strong pressures and
reduced to the unforced case for $P=0$.
The shape statistics found here show qualitative agreement with the
results in intermediate and deep water, and future work on periodic
shallow-water waves would allow a direct, quantitative comparison with
the periodic deep-water waves.
